Dockerfile for the [`google/debian:wheezy`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/google/debian/) image with package [`openjdk-7-jre-headless`](https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/openjdk-7-jre-headless) installed.

Note that to get updated versions of `ca-certificates` and `tzdata` you may want to either rebuild this periodically or layer updates to those packages on top.
